## Background

I am currently a PhD student exploring faculty job opportunities across the United States. An essential factor in my search is finding a location that supports both my professional aspirations and my personal life, particularly concerning my daughter's education. She is a Chinese heritage language learner, and it is crucial for us that she continues to learn and engage with her mother's culture and language. Thus, this map serves as a tool to visualize areas that align with our family's needs and professional goals.

## Purpose of the Map

The interactive map provides a visual representation of cities across the U.S. that host universities with various research levels and are known for their Chinese communities. Each city on the map is marked according to the presence of R1 and R2 research universities:

- **Red Dot**: Indicates cities with only R1 universities.
- **Green Dot**: Indicates cities with only R2 universities.
- **Blue Dot**: Indicates cities with both R1 and R2 universities.

Upon hovering over each dot, detailed information is displayed about the universities and immersion schools in that city, aiding in quick and informative decision-making regarding potential places to live and work.

## How to Use the Map

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Explore the map by zooming and panning through different regions.
3. Hover over any city dot to see detailed information about the universities and Chinese immersion schools available in that area.

## Conclusion

This map was created to streamline the process of finding a suitable location that meets both academic career needs and cultural environment requirements for Chinese heritage learners. It is hoped that other academic professionals in similar situations might find this resource helpful.
